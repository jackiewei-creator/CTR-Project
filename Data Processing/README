# Digital Marketing CTR Prediction Using Cross-Domain User Modeling

This repository presents a structured workflow for ad click-through rate (CTR) prediction using the [Digix Global AI Challenge – Digital Marketing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiaojiu1414/digix-global-ai-challenge).

The project enhances CTR estimation by leveraging **cross-domain behavioral data** — integrating user behavior from the **news feeds domain** (source) with ad interaction data from the **ads domain** (target).

| Notebook | Title | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **1_DataCleaning.ipynb** | Data Cleaning and Preprocessing | Cleans and normalizes ads and feeds datasets for consistency and readiness. |
| **2_FeedsAggregation.ipynb** | Feed-Level User Aggregation | Aggregates news feed logs into per-user profiles that represent behavior, diversity, and time patterns. |
| **3_AdsMerge_Modeling.ipynb** | Ads–Feeds Integration and CTR Prediction | Merges user profiles with ads data, performs EDA, and builds predictive CTR models. |

## 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### Objective
Prepare four raw datasets — `train_data_ads.csv`, `test_data_ads.csv`, `train_data_feeds.csv`, and `test_data_feeds.csv` — into structured, type-consistent, and model-ready formats.

### Main Steps
1. **Data inspection:** Checked shape, columns, and structure; identified `label` in `train_data_ads` as the target.  
2. **Unified cleaning rules:**  
   - Missing values → numeric `-1`, categorical `"unknown"`, multi-value `""`.  
   - IDs/enums cast to `category`; numerical fields kept as `int` or `float`.  
   - Parsed timestamps to derive `t_hour`, `t_wday`, `t_is_weekend`.  
   - Added `_len` and `_uniq` summaries for multi-value string fields.  
3. **Ads domain cleanup:** Created 17 derived columns, ensured consistent schema between train/test, verified CTR ≈ 1.55%.  
4. **Feeds domain cleanup:** Generated 11 derived columns (temporal + behavioral), standardized schema across train/test.  
5. **Outputs:**
